# Responsive Feed Component CSS

This repository contains CSS styles for a responsive feed component, designed to be used with React or similar frontend frameworks. The styles create a clean, flexible input area and options section that adjust smoothly across different screen sizes without causing unwanted scrollbars.

## Features

- Flexible and responsive feed container with max-width control
- Stylish input container with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Input field that expands and wraps nicely on smaller screens
- Input options section that adapts layout from horizontal to vertical on mobile
- Prevents horizontal scrollbars by handling overflow and flexible sizing

## How to Use

1. Add the CSS file (`Feed.css`) to your project.
2. Apply the following class names to your JSX/HTML structure:

```jsx
<div className="feed">
  <div className="feed__inputContainer">
    <div className="feed__input">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Write something..." />
    </div>
    <div className="feed__inputOptions">
      {/* Your input option buttons/icons here */}
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Your feed posts/components here */}
</div>
````

3. Make sure your parent containers allow the `.feed` component to expand up to 700px max-width or 100% on smaller screens.

## Responsive Behavior

* On large screens, input and options align horizontally with spacing.
* On tablets, padding adjusts to fit screen width without overflow.
* On mobile devices (≤480px), input box and options stack vertically for better usability.

## Troubleshooting

* If you see horizontal scrollbars, check for any child elements that exceed container widths.
* Use `box-sizing: border-box;` to ensure padding does not increase total width.
* Adjust the `min-width` of input fields carefully for very small screens.
