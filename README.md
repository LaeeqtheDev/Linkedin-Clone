# Responsive Feed Component CSS

This repository contains CSS styles for a responsive feed component designed for React or other frontend projects. It features a clean input section and an input options area that adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes without causing unwanted scrollbars.

## Features

- Responsive layout with flexible widths and padding
- Styled input container with rounded corners and shadows
- Input field that grows/shrinks responsively
- Input options area that wraps or stacks depending on screen size
- Prevents horizontal scrollbars on smaller screens

## Usage

Include the CSS styles in your project and use the following HTML/JSX structure:

```html
<div class="feed">
  <div class="feed__inputContainer">
    <div class="feed__input">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Search or post something..." />
    </div>
    <div class="feed__inputOptions">
      <!-- Input option buttons or icons -->
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Feed posts go here -->
</div>
````

## Responsive Behavior

* On desktop and tablets, the input and options align horizontally with spacing.
* On mobile (screen width ≤ 480px), the input and options stack vertically for better usability.

## Notes

* The `.feed` container uses `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling.
* Input field has a minimum width but adjusts on small devices.
* Ensure child elements do not exceed container width to maintain layout integrity.
